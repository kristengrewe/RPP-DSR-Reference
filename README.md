# Case Study Days  
## Generate Groups of 3/4 students  
> Simple code for random list of RPP2 students, which can be used to choose pairs, groups of size k < n, and order of presentations: 

```python
import numpy as np
RPP2_students = ['Becky_MDT', 'Bahar_PST', 'Andrew_EST', 'Mekdi_PST', 'Tony_PST', 'Robert_CT',
			'Sean_PST?', 'Nick_PST', 'Reza_CT', 'Bobby_AZ', 'Di_PST', 'Gary_EST', 
			'Matthew_EST', 'Shaheer_AZ', 'Marwah_PST']

np.random.choice(RPP2_students, replace=False, size=len(RPP2_students))
```

## Assign breakout rooms 

## Progress checks

1. MVP plan

> - use MVP+, MVP++, future work to handle overly optimistic plans
> - plan should include hypothetic audience

2. Github repo  
> forked by student A  
> cloned from student A by other team members 

- [Ryan & Heather example video](https://zoom.us/rec/share/WYhK0DE1ZBs4lvN33JDCp3eMHl7QTycVjlaRXbWCgaXcVvwJ8CBzsrVFqjvMln1T.oETxz6XDF0QB1LuA?startTime=1616691949000)
> - suggest VSCode Live Share for README.md  

3. Slide deck/presentation tool started  

______________

# Capstone Days    

## Manually Assign breakout rooms 

## Stand-ups
> [RPP2 Stand-ups Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lztQRmiV1DQrzRyrgY0Lc_VqVFRYh7hXf0kuqDLs66k/edit#gid=0) 
Check:
1. Well defined MVP
2. Cohesive, narrow Story
3. GitHub repo + README + Slide Deck started

- Elevator Pitch (30 second engaging overview) 
- Follow-up on meeting goals from last stand-up
- Goals for today
- ABC always be committing

______________

# Career Services Days  

- ### Record with permission from CSM

- ### This is an appropriate time for DSRs to turn off camera and complete [other tasks](#Weekly-Tasks)

## Post CSM recording after it processes 
- edit recording name to include: *instructor, topic(s), date*
- check that no passcode is required
  
- ### Add zoom link in career services videos markdown file in VSCode:
	```bash
	cd dsi-learn-welcome-template
	git pull  
	git checkout RPP2 
	git pull  
	code .
	```

- ### Save changes:

	```bash
	learn preview -o .
	git add .
	git commit -m 'added CSM video'
	git push origin RPP2
	```

- ### In Learn:
	1. **SET UP** tab
	2. **Repos** tab
	3. **<block_name>** block will have a green 'updates' oval

______________

# Pair Programming

* Create pairs for any paired assignment - Choose one person to be the “scheduler”
* Refer to your [Cohort Hub](#quick-links) *Important Docs* Tab for pairs google sheet (this sheet is student facing)

### Example of simple code for random list of students, which can be used to choose pairs, groups of size k < n, and order of presentations: 

``` python
import numpy as np
RPP2_students = ['Becky_MDT', 'Bahar_PST', 'Andrew_EST', 'Mekdi_PST', 'Tony_PST', 'Robert_CT', 'Sean_PST', 'Nick_PST', 'Reza_CT', 'Bobby_AZ', 'Di_PST', 'Gary_EST', 'Matthew_EST', 'Shaheer_AZ', 'Marwah_PST']

np.random.choice(RPP2_students, replace=False, size=len(RPP2_students))
```
	
**Challenges**  
- Sometimes students may express that they don't want to work with another student. Different instructors handle this differently, 	posting the proposed pairs/groups to the team allows feedback and maybe adjustments.  
- Different time zones and work/family schedules can make pair programming difficult for part-time cohorts. 

	Ask instructor regarding:   
	- pairing based on time zones or schedules (alternatives to random pairings) 
	- due date extensions with prior approval

> [* updating pairs how to video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_2FXEfwQswyXi7L2QyT6RjbIrMmwbIkf/view?usp=sharing)

# Assignments & Solutions

## Assignment Submissions

### Checking Assignment Submissions in LEARN
1. **UNIT PROGRESS** tab
2. **<block_name>** use down arrow
3. <Assignment_name> use down arrow   
4. <Assignment_Submission> small circle indicates 'submitted'

### After checking submissions in LEARN, update Assignment Submission Sheet in HUB 

> A one-class grace has bee the norm. For example, if the assignment is due on Tuesday, checking for that assignment submission + updating the google sheet on Thursday worked well. At the discretion of the instructor/PL, students may ask for an extension to the due date.

> [* checking and updating assignment submissions how to video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BvwxMJU055kYyfC1eC52urwPriOdBGa9/view?usp=sharing)

## Assignment Due Dates:
- In general, the due date is a week from the corresponding lecture.  
- Async assignments are due a week from that week's Saturday lecture.
- Paired assignments should be italicized
